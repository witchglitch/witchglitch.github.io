<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/klammer.gif" class="w3-image"> Hey, I'm Lena. I am a zine maker, a researcher in the field of social psychology,
  a dreamer, a cyberspace admirer, an internet enthusiast, a witch, a capybara in disguise. My other interests are: magic & glitter, virtual reality,
  lucid dreaming, psychogeography, ouija boards, urban psychosis, hysteria, star dust cultivation (under my bed) and time loops.</p>

<p>I see the internet as a great place for experimenting with different personas/identities. I share Turkles' (1996) concept of
  "distributed identities",
identity not as a fixed concept but the self as a multiple system. and I think the internet is a great place to experiment with it.</p>

<p>The WWW can also be a home for all the weirdos, the bedridden, the outsiders, the shy ones. For me as a natural anxious person, the internet
is both shelter and extension of my world. I can engage with people and talk with them differently as I could ever offline. I can life strange
fantasies and interests because there always seem to be people who share the same ones.
I also love the idea of the handmade web, a term created by J. R. Carpenter. She refers to pages made by individuals rather by social media
corporations. She also connects making webpages with the DIY culture:</p>

<blockquote> "I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines,
  pamphlets,
and artists books."
- J. R. Carpenter, 2015 </blockquote>


<p>Reading that made me think about my own first handmade webpage many years ago. It had comic sans font (oh yes, that's right), flashing gifs,
a black star background, flash animations and javascript applets. It was kinda trashy but the memory alone brings nostalgic feelings with it.
Later I turned to WYSIWYG (<b>W</b>hat <b>Y</b>ou <b>S</b>ee <b>I</b>s <b>W</b>hat <b>Y</b>ou <b>G</b>et) programs and tinkered around with it
for hours. I created pages not to put it online,
just for fun to see how different html codes and scripts turn out.
Then the new era of the web 2.0 started and with it came user sites on large social networks. I poshed up my myspace profile, later I created
my facebook account and forgot most of my webdesign knowledge.
But here I am now, building again a website from scratch and remember how much fun it makes to create something on my own again (and learning that
css can do much more than back in the days). I don't think that social media is necessarily a bad thing, but I'm drawn to amateurish, personal, intimate,
selfmade things.</p>
<p>And please - look at this site and then tell me you don't feel anything: <a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net/" class="underline">caution sound!</a></p>
