Madwoman in the Attic explores the character Bertha Mason from the famous novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte BrontÃ«. Bertha Mason is portrayed as a Creolean woman who is married to Mr. Rochester and banished into the attic of Thornfield Hall out of his sight. This zine is dedicated to Bertha and explores postcolonial topics as well as the portrayal of Bertha Mason as a "wild and crazy" woman.
Inside is an essay about problematic aspects of the novel, photos, paintings and (re)written parts of Bertha's story.
